                    I'm a sophomore at the Rochester Institute of Technology studying Game Design and Development.

                    <br><br> Some things to know about me: I'm a pretty big fan of 
                    all-things gaming and game design, I love my adorable cats, and I love the rain! This webpage 
                    is an accumulation of web development projects as I learn more throughout the semester and 
                    develop my skills. Hope you enjoy your stay!

                    For Homework 2, we were required to practice basic HTML structure standards to upload
                    a number of HTML files to the web and practice proper file structure and organization.

                    <h3>Homework 2: <a href="https://people.rit.edu/nrf8249/IGME235/Homework_Basic_Game_Page/">Basic Game Page</a></h3>
                    <p>
                    For Homework 2, I decided to do a basic game page for The Last of Us: Part 1, referencing
                    the style of MobyGames' game pages. This project mostly revolved around properly inserting images, 
                    links, and other text-formatting, such as lists, and bold text.

                    <p>
                    Surprise! Homework 3 was this homepage for IMGE235. 
                    For this project, we developed and practiced our skills of formatting, floating, etc. 
                    while maintaining all proper web development standards.
